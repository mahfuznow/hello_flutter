### Dart Coding Guidelines

- **Code Formatting:**
    - Use Dart’s built-in formatter (`dart format`) to maintain consistent code style.
    - Adhere to the Dart Style Guide to ensure uniformity across your codebase.
- **Function Naming Conventions:**
    - Use camelCase for function names (e.g., `calculateTotalAmount`).
    - Names should be descriptive and convey the function’s purpose.
- **Variable Naming Conventions:**
    - Use camelCase for variable names (e.g., `userAge`).
    - Avoid single-letter or ambiguous names.
- **Constants Usage:**
    - Use `const` for compile-time constants and `final` for runtime constants.
    - Define constants in a central place to avoid duplication.

### Folder Structure: Folder by Feature

- **Organizational Strategy:**
    - Structure your project by feature rather than by type (e.g., `auth`, `profile`, `settings`).
    - Create separate folders for each feature containing its components, services, and data models.
- **Example Structure:**
    - `lib/features/auth/` contains authentication logic, UI, and models.
    - `lib/features/profile/` includes profile-related code.
- **Benefits:**
    - Enhances modularity and separation of concerns.
    - Facilitates easier navigation and scaling of the project.

### MVVM Architecture

- **Overview:**
    - **Model:** Represents the data structure and business logic.
    - **View:** Displays the UI and binds to the ViewModel.
    - **ViewModel:** Manages state and business logic, communicating between the View and Model.
- **Benefits:**
    - Clear separation between UI and business logic.
    - Promotes testability by isolating business logic from the UI.

      Flutter: [MVVM Architecture in Flutter](https://medium.flutterdevs.com/flutter-mvvm-architecture-29f1322eb2da)

### Repository Pattern

- **Concept:**
    - Abstract data access to a repository, which acts as an intermediary between the data source
      and the application.
- **Benefits:**
    - Decouples business logic from data sources, making it easier to switch between data sources (
      e.g., from a remote API to a local database).
- **Implementation Example:**
    - Create `UserRepository` that handles user data operations, abstracting data source
      interactions.

  **Reference:**
    - Repository
      Pattern: [Repository Pattern in Dart](https://medium.flutterdevs.com/flutter-repository-pattern-fd4c5db2de36)

### Coding on Abstraction

- **Principle:**
    - Write code to an abstract interface rather than concrete implementations.
- **Advantages:**
    - Enhances flexibility by allowing easy substitution of different implementations.
    - Facilitates unit testing by enabling the use of mock implementations.
- **Example:**
    - Define abstract classes for services and repositories, and provide concrete implementations
      that adhere to these abstractions.

  **Reference:**
    - Abstraction in
      Dart: [Dart Programming Language](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/create-library-packages#defining-interfaces)

### Separation of Concerns

- **Definition:**
    - Dividing the application into distinct sections, each handling a specific aspect of the
      functionality.
- **Application:**
    - Keep UI code separate from business logic and data access code.
    - Use architectural patterns like MVVM or Clean Architecture to enforce separation.
- **Benefits:**
    - Improves maintainability and scalability.
    - Makes the codebase easier to understand and manage.

  **Reference:**
    - Separation of
      Concerns: [Separation of Concerns in Flutter](https://medium.flutterdevs.com/flutter-separation-of-concerns-b7e9b61ef282)

### KISS Principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

- **Principle:**
    - Aim for simplicity in design and implementation.
- **Application:**
    - Write clear, concise code.
    - Avoid over-engineering and unnecessary complexity.
- **Benefits:**

    - Reduces potential for bugs and simplifies maintenance.

  **Reference:**
    - KISS
      Principle: [KISS Principle in Software Engineering](https://www.guru99.com/kiss-principle.html)

### DRY Principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself)

- **Principle:**
    - Avoid duplicating code; instead, create reusable components and functions.
- **Application:**
    - Refactor common logic into reusable functions or widgets.
    - Use inheritance or composition to share functionality.
- **Benefits:**
    - Reduces redundancy.
    - Simplifies updates and maintenance.

  **Reference:**
    - DRY
      Principle: [DRY Principle in Software Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

### SOLID Principles

- **Overview:**
    - **S:** Single Responsibility Principle - A class should have only one reason to change.
    - **O:** Open/Closed Principle - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for
      modification.
    - **L:** Liskov Substitution Principle - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
    - **I:** Interface Segregation Principle - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces
      they do not use.
    - **D:** Dependency Inversion Principle - High-level modules should not depend on low-level
      modules; both should depend on abstractions.
- **Application:**
    - Apply these principles to design flexible, maintainable, and scalable systems.

  **Reference:**
    - SOLID
      Principles: [SOLID Principles in Object-Oriented Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)
