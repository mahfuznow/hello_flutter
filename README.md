# Flutter Boilerplate

A starter template for Flutter projects designed to streamline the development process and ensure a
scalable, maintainable codebase.

## Features

- **Dynamic Layouts**: Adjusts based on device type (Mobile/Tablet) and orientation (
  Portrait/Landscape).
- **MVVM Architecture**: Preconfigured with a base setup for scalable code structure.
- **State Management**: Utilizes `ValueNotifier` for efficient and simple state management.
- **Base classes**: Utilized Base classes for reduce developer effort for common functionalities.
- **Network Calls**: Integrated with the `http` package for making network requests.
- **Navigation**: Employs Navigator 2.0 with support for passing arguments between screens.
- **Localizations**: Built-in support for multiple languages. In app language change support.
- **Material Theme**: Customizable dark and light themes. In-app theme change support.
- **Environment Configuration**: Managed using `DotEnv` for different environments.
- **Build Flavors**: Supports multiple build flavors including Dev, Test, Staging, and Prod.
- **Dependency Injection**: Created our own Dependency container so that it doesn't depends on third
  party library.
- **Modular approach**: Data, Domain layer is separated by making them individual flutter package
- **Code Generation**: When we need to add a new feature we can run script to generate all the
  necessary code to start with following our architecture.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio: [Install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
    - Version: 2024.1.1
- FVM: [Install FVM](https://fvm.app/documentation/getting-started/installation)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flutter-boilerplate.git
   cd flutter-boilerplate
   ```
1. **Set up FVM**:
   ```bash
   fvm install 3.24.3
   fvm use 3.24.3
   ```
1. **Setup Flutter SDK in Android Studio**:
    - Open Android Studio
    - Go to `File > Settings > Languages & Frameworks > Flutter`
    - Set the FVM Flutter SDK path to the location of your Flutter SDK
    - Click `Apply` and then `OK`
1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   fvm flutter pub get
   ```
1. **Set up environment variables**:
   See [Environment setup guide](env/README.md) for more information.

### Running the App

To run the app with a specific build flavor:

- In the Android Studio, you can choose runConfigurations from the top right corner and select the
  desired flavor to run the app.
    - These run configurations are already set up for each flavor at `.idea/runConfigurations` which
      is tracked by git.
- Or else if you want to run the app from the terminal, you can use the following commands:

```bash
flutter run --flavor flavor_dev -t lib/main/main_flavor_dev.dart
flutter run --flavor flavor_test -t lib/main/main_flavor_test.dart
flutter run --flavor flavor_staging -t lib/main/main_flavor_staging.dart
flutter run --flavor flavor_prod -t lib/main/main_flavor_prod.dart
```

### Generate boilerplate code for new feature

Either you can use the `create_feature` run configuration to run the script then input the feature
name in the run console
orElse,

```bash
cd lib/presentation/feature
dart create_feature.dart feature_name
```

## Change App Name and Application ID

## Flutter

In AndroidStudio Go to Edit > Find > Replace in Files (Ctrl + Shift + R) and replace the following
`hello_flutter` with `your_app_name`.

### Android

- Open `app/build.gradle` file and change the applicationId to your desired app name.

```bash
android {
    namespace "com.mahfuznow.hello_flutter"
    
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.mahfuznow.hello_flutter"
    }
    
    productFlavors {
        flavor_dev {
            dimension "env"
            applicationId "com.mahfuznow.hello_flutter_dev"
            resValue "string", "app_name", "Hello Flutter Dev"
        }
        flavor_test {
            dimension "env"
            applicationId "com.mahfuznow.hello_flutter_test"
            resValue "string", "app_name", "Hello Flutter Test"
        }
        flavor_staging {
            dimension "env"
            applicationId "com.mahfuznow.hello_flutter_staging"
            resValue "string", "app_name", "Hello Flutter Staging"
        }
        flavor_prod {
            dimension "env"
            applicationId "com.mahfuznow.hello_flutter"
            resValue "string", "app_name", "Hello Flutter"
        }
    }
}
```

- Rename the `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/mahfuznow/hello_flutter` folder to your desired
  package name.
- Update the package declaration in the `MainActivity.kt` file to match the new folder name.
    - For example, if the folder is renamed to `com/mahfuznow/hello_flutter`, the package
      declaration
      should be `package com.mahfuznow.hello_flutter`.

### iOS

- open `ios/Flutter/flavor_devDebug.xcconfig` and change the `BUNDLE_NAME` and `BUNDLE_DISPLAY_NAME`
  to your desired app name.
- open `ios/Flutter/flavor_testDebug.xcconfig` and change the `BUNDLE_NAME`
  and `BUNDLE_DISPLAY_NAME` to your desired app name.
- open `ios/Flutter/flavor_stagingDebug.xcconfig` and change the `BUNDLE_NAME`
  and `BUNDLE_DISPLAY_NAME` to your desired app name.
- open `ios/Flutter/flavor_prodDebug.xcconfig` and change the `BUNDLE_NAME`
  and `BUNDLE_DISPLAY_NAME` to your desired app name.
- open `ios/Flutter/flavor_devRelease.xcconfig` and change the `BUNDLE_NAME`
  and `BUNDLE_DISPLAY_NAME` to your desired app name.
- open `ios/Flutter/flavor_testRelease.xcconfig` and change the `BUNDLE_NAME`
  and `BUNDLE_DISPLAY_NAME` to your desired app name.
- open `ios/Flutter/flavor_stagingRelease.xcconfig` and change the `BUNDLE_NAME`
  and `BUNDLE_DISPLAY_NAME` to your desired app name.
- open `ios/Flutter/flavor_prodRelease.xcconfig` and change the `BUNDLE_NAME`
  and `BUNDLE_DISPLAY_NAME` to your desired app name.

To change the bundle identifier, open the `ios/Runner.xcodeproj` file in Xcode and update manually
using Xcode UI for each build type.

## Change App Icon

### Generate different app icons for different flavors

- Using [Icon Kitchen](https://icon.kitchen/) we can generate different app icons (Badge) for
  different flavors.
- This website will provide the necessary files for both Android and iOS.
- For Android, we can use the `res` folder which is provided by the website.
- For iOS, we can upscale the `play_store_512.png` file to 1024x1024 using
  this [Image Resizer](https://imageresizer.com/), then open the iOS project in
  Xcode and add this image to the Assets.xcassets folder, setting it as a single size in the image
  properties.

### Flutter

Replace `assets/images/app_logo.png` with your desired icon for the app.

### Android

- Replace the `android/app/src/flavor_dev/res` folder with your desired icon for Dev app.
- Replace the `android/app/src/flavor_test/res` folder with your desired icon for Test app.
- Replace the `android/app/src/flavor_staging/res` folder with your desired icon for Staging app.
- Replace the `android/app/src/main/res` folder with your desired icon for Prod app.

### iOS

- Replace the `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/flavor_devAppIcon.appiconset` folder with your desired
  icon for Dev app.
- Replace the `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/flavor_testAppIcon.appiconset` folder with your desired
  icon for Test app.
- Replace the `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/flavor_stagingAppIcon.appiconset` folder with your desired
  icon for Staging app.
- Replace the `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset` folder with your desired icon for Prod
  app.
